# ObjectBox Upgrade Guide

This guide explains the changes made to upgrade ObjectBox from version 2.5.1 to 4.1.0 and what needs to be done to complete the upgrade.

## Changes Made

1. Updated ObjectBox dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`:
   - `objectbox: ^4.1.0`
   - `objectbox_flutter_libs: ^4.1.0`
   - `objectbox_generator: ^4.1.0`

2. Regenerated ObjectBox model files using build_runner:
   ```
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

3. Updated the ObjectBox implementation in `lib/models/objectbox/objectbox.dart` to work with the new version.

4. Updated the ObjectBoxService in `lib/services/objectbox_service.dart` to use the updated ObjectBox class.

5. Created a test app in `lib/test_objectbox.dart` to verify ObjectBox functionality.

## Next Steps

To complete the upgrade, follow these steps:

1. Install CocoaPods on your macOS system if not already installed:
   ```
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   ```

2. Run pod install in the macOS directory of the Flutter project:
   ```
   cd macos
   pod install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Run the test app to verify ObjectBox functionality:
   ```
   flutter run -d macos lib/test_objectbox.dart
   ```

4. If the test app works correctly, you can run the main app:
   ```
   flutter run -d macos
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with ObjectBox after the upgrade:

1. Check that the ObjectBox model files were regenerated correctly. If not, run:
   ```
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

2. Verify that the ObjectBox store is being created correctly in the `ObjectBox.create()` method.

3. Check that the ObjectBoxRepository is being initialized with a valid store.

4. If you encounter issues with the web platform, note that ObjectBox is primarily designed for native platforms (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux) and may not work well on web.

## Additional Notes

- The ObjectBox API has changed significantly between versions 2.5.1 and 4.1.0. Make sure to check the [ObjectBox documentation](https://docs.objectbox.io/flutter-dart-sdk) for details on the new API.

- If you need to use the app on web platforms, consider implementing a different persistence solution for web, such as IndexedDB or localStorage.

- The SQLite adapter has been removed as part of the transition to ObjectBox.
