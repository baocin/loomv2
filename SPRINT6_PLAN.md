## 🔧 Technical Tasks

### Container Warmup Implementation
```yaml
# Example readiness probe configuration
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /readyz
    port: 8004
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  successThreshold: 1
  failureThreshold: 3

# Startup probe for slow model loading
startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8004
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  failureThreshold: 30  # Allow 5 minutes for model loading
```

### DLQ Topic Structure
- `dlq.image.processing` - Failed image processing tasks
- `dlq.audio.processing` - Failed audio processing tasks
- `dlq.text.processing` - Failed text processing tasks
- `dlq.general` - Other processing failures

### Processing Timeout Configuration
- **Audio processing**: 2 minutes maximum
- **Image processing**: 5 minutes maximum
- **Text processing**: 1 minute maximum
- **Document processing**: 3 minutes maximum

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### AI Service Testing Enhancements
